# Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
+ Well established relationship between alcohol and (adverse) effects on health.

+ Big picture: higher consumption of alcohol is associated with worse health.

+ Causal evidence is scarce

+ Quasi-experimental designs are a natural, potential, solution

# Historical Background

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Before Bratt: 
  + High levels of alcohol consumption (vodka belt) 
  + 1922 prohibition referendum

The Bratt system: a system of individual control (approx. 1920-1955)
  + Rationing booklet
  + Additional controls such as individual sanctions

After Bratt: Systembolaget
  + Established in the end of 1955

# Institutional setting
![](images/2x_rollout.svg)



Guidelines:

+ 1955-82: Main town to nearest store > 40 km; Population > 5000
+ After 1982: Main town to nearest store > 30km
+ Stated goal of 'a couple' new store locations (municipalities) per year^[Average time from announcement to opening was 30 months (std.dev. 20), based on 90 store openings.]


## A snapshot from 1955

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
+ No delivery-point sales on the municipality $\times$ year level

# Data

+ All cause mortality (1968-2023)
  + Municipality of residence

+ Motor vehicle accidents (1985-2023)
  + Municipality of accident
  
+ Sales in Liters of (1978-2008)
  + 100° alcohol

## Municipality reforms and sample restrictions

+ 900 municipalities in 1968, 288 in 1996 (Source: REGINA, SCB)

+ Mortality data aggregated to 1995 municipal borders

+ Mortality sample restricted to 1968-1996



# Empirical strategy and design

The population equation of interest is

\begin{equation}
    Y_{mt} = \gamma_m + \lambda_t + \beta_{mt}  \text{store}_{mt} + \epsilon_{mt}\, ,
    \label{eq:pop-eq-of-interest}
\end{equation}



+ Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) 
+ Long differences with base-period $t=-1$
+ Time-invariant controls (population size)



# Results

1. Sales
2. Mortality
3. Motor vehicle accidents

## Staggered adoption schedule (sales)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
+ 1st store test uses municipalities with no store as the control group

+ 2nd store test uses municipalities with *only* one store as the control group^[Included in the treatment group for the 2nd store test are: <br> Borgholm, Enköping, Härjedalen, Järfälla, Kävlinge, <br>Malung-Sälen, Sollefteå, Sollentuna, Västervik and Åre.]

## 1st and 2nd store results {.smaller background-color="white"}
![](images/sales_results.svg)

+ 1st store test: positive increase^[The 1st coefficient is lower is because of late in the year store openings]

+ 2nd store test ATT: 33\%^[$=\text{exp}(0.28432)-1$]

## Staggered adoption schedule (mortality)

## All-cause mortality

![](images/mod1_deaths_CS.svg)


## Population size

![](images/mod2_deaths_CS.svg)

## Taking population into account

1. $y_{mt} = \frac{\#Deaths}{\#Population}$
2. $\frac{1}{\#Population}$
3. Including lagged values of population size

Instead:  Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)

# SUTVA: definition
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Concern: cross-boundary spillover

Test: define municipalities with at least one store as treated when the *neighboring* municipality opens a store.
  
  + Comparison group has at least one store but the neighbor does *not* open a store.

If SUTVA is violated, there should be a negative effect on sales.

## SUTVA: results {.smaller background-color="white"}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
There are indeed violations of the SUTVA assumption (ATT = 5%) for the full sample.

Using the 2nd store test sample, there is no detectable violations against SUTVA.

# Summing up

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Caveats:

+ Substitution effect?
  + Moonshine
  + Pickup points (add percentages here)
  + Other sources of alcohol

If we multiply the coefficient on total alcohol sales from the 'Saturday' experiment by the number of days Systembolaget is open (today), we get $0.035 \times 6 = 0.21$, compared to the $0.25$ from the 2nd store test (column 5).
